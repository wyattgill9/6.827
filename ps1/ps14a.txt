A

By performing two different reductions of the term 
let g = λx. g (g x); in g (λx. x), 
we showed that the resulting terms are not confluent. 
This happens because the recursive definition of g creates an infinite expansion, 
and the terms produced by different reduction paths grow in different ways.

B

let g = λx. g (g x); in g (λx. x) translates to:
(λg. g (λx. x)) ((λg. (λx. g (x x)) (λx. g (x x))) (λg. λx. g (g x)))

let g = λx. g x; in g (λx. x) translates to:
(λg. g (λx. x)) ((λg. (λx. g (x x)) (λx. g (x x))) (λg. λx. g x))

C

The translation of the initial term cannot be reduced to the translation of Term 2 
because the definitions of g in the two terms are different (λx. g (g x) vs. λx. g x). 
These differences are preserved in the translations. There is NO reduction path in pure λ-calculus 
that can reconcile them. If we modify the initial term to match Term 2's definition, then the translations 
become identical, and reduction is trivially possible.
